# LUCIUM-Weather ❄🌞

⚠Automate on Android required to run this script.
🌤

*If script is started/restarted during middle of the day, change the original wallpaper link to closest time of day in flow.

** This flow/script only works with home screen wallpapers as of now.

This flow changes a wallpaper to a specified date and time that can be set for a one time occurrence or for reoccurring instance. This will consume lesser battery life compared to native live/slideshow wallpapers as it's background process takes very low ram and battery resources.

 Do note that this flow is still in testing stages therefore it is not guaranteed to work as mentioned above.

->How to use:

Once you have downloaded the script, you will have to change the source files on the script to one that is stored on your local device. This is supposed to be the wallpaper. You can replicate the amount of wallpapers to change and what time to change in the script.
